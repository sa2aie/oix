== Resolving Endpoints

To find an endpoint for a domain the sender has to resolve the domain endpoint
using dns.

Once found the sender has to get the domains signing certificate, also published
using dns.

Equipped with this, the sender can get a list of consumers from the endpoint.

API Versioning

The api is versioned and all major releases must be compatible with itself and
it is only allowed to add fields and operations to an api. Breaking changes
will increase the major version. It is however allowed to add functionality to
to api, increasing the minor version. A client implemented using an older version
of the api will then function even if there are features added to the api.
