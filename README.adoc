The project is intended to create a specification for information interchange
and also some reference implementations.

The intended uses is machine / system to system replication of information,
with no central administration.

This project is based on the ideas of SMTP and the simplicity of creating
a service. It will add required features for security and authentication that
is missing from the original SMTP protocol. It will also use json
as a transport format to ease parsing of messages.

Even if ths project is licensed using the MIT license, there is a need to keep
a central registry of all defined message types to allow for information interchange



The project will go through a few phases:

1. Define the scope of the project
2. Define transport level protocol
3. Define a few standardised basic entites.
4. Create test implementations
5. Goto 1


Examples are done as a me learning node.js project.

The goal is to have a final specification for v 1.0 in Q4 2020.
